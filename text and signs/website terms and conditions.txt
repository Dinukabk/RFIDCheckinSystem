TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This user account allows you to enter and update your user profile for The Edge's Checkin System. 
The profile includes e.g. your background, areas of interest, skills or projects you are currently working from.
There are several "Check-in points" at The Edge, where you can swipe your 
membership card at. By doing so, you will leave a digital footprint at that checkin location, which contains a 
timestamp and your profile information. The Checkin system aggregates and visualises this information in
graphical and textual form using different media in The Edge building, such as projections or public
and ambient displays, as well as social media sites, e.g. wall posts on The Edge's facebook site and tweets
via Twitter.
The aim of the checkin system is to help you identify and connect to interesting others in The Edge community.
We hope that the system will help you identify and ice-break conversations with other interesting folks at the Edge.
Please only enter information in your user profile that you feel comfortable sharing across The Edge community. Use and 
participation in the Checkin system is voluntary. 

This system is part of a PhD research study undertaken at the Urban Informatics Research Lab at QUT by Mark Bilandzic, and 
developed as an open-source project (https://github.com/markbil/RFIDCheckinSystem). If you have any feedback, comments or
want to join the project, pease send an e-mail to markbilandzic@gmail.com.
