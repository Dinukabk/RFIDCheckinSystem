TODO Checkin System:

---HIGH PRIORITY---


2) error handling at signup.php: what happens if?
Done >> - user selects a username that already exists?
 Need to create Form >> - Edge staff enters an RFID card number that was
already assigned to another Edge visitor?
Done >> - signup.php: add "repeat password field", only accept signup if
both passwords match

3) include two checkboxes (mutually exclusive, i.e. you can select one
OR the other OR none of them (default is none)):
Need to do >> - I am happy to be approached by other users
Don't Disturb implemented >> - Don't talk to me, I busy doing my own stuff

	the checkboxes connect to the "dontdisturb" field in the "edge_users" table (as of meetmee_checkin6.sql):
	happy to talk to others = 0
	don't talk to me = 1
	no box checked (default) = NULL (default value in the DB, so nothing needs to be passed)


Need to do >> 5) add "terms and conditions" check-box at signup.php
page. box must be ticked in order to signup. "terms and conditions"
label is a link
that opens a new browser window... I am working with the Edge on the
content, e.g. users must admit that their content will be visible
on public screens, projections, etc...

Need to do >> 6) add DB fields and checkboxes in profile page for
"background". background can be "technology", "art", "music", "DIY",

Need to do >> 7) add Feedback form to profile page. "Let us know what
you think about this system! Send us your Feedback" => Link to
pop up html page. writes feedback to DB field feedback!


Mark B:
- Need to do >> 8) add google analytics to profile website

- signup.php >> how did you find out about the checkin system?

Usability web interface:

- what if a user forgot his password? => email password to his email address
- Projects => name: Meetings, Collaborations, Projects
	- should be listed within the user_edge website, similar to interests and expertise, rather than separate file... save a click! 



---MEDIUM PRIORITY---

forgot your RFID card?
6) JQuery mobile website version of the profile website?



---LOW PRIORITY---

9) update-profile.php:
- right now swipe-id cannot be changed (text field not editable), but what happens if user looses his RFID card. => my suggestion for the 1st rollout: write us an email and we change it in the DB.. later we might think about an administration userinterface for such purposesâ€¦





TODO: MARK

***userprofile page:
	*consists of different sections which might be designed to be collapsable?
	- Profile Info
		-É
		-É
	
	- Status Info
		- Status message: [textfield]
		
		- I am happy to be approached by other users. [checkbox] (=> linked to "dontdisturb" field in the "edge_users" table)
		- Don't talk to me, I busy doing my own stuff today. [checkbox]	
	
	- What's your background / interests?
		- predefined category 1 [checkbox] => (linked with MySQL category_table)
		- predefined category 2 [checkbox]
		- predefined category 3 [checkbox]
		- É e.g. photography
		- É e.g. design / music / coding etc..
		- predefined category n [checkbox]
	
		- open textfield 1 => (linked with MySQL interest_table)
		- open textfield 2
		- open textfield 3
		
		[*don't delete, but hide expertise levels for background / interests*]
	
	- What skills and knowledge can you share with other Edge users?
		- open textfield 1 [checkbox]
		- É
		[amend labelling in drop down listsÉ (1 beginner - 5
	expert)]
	
	- What topics / issues do you need help with from other users? (140 characters)
		- 
	
	- Projects
		É
	
	- Which of your social media posts / content do you want to share with the Checkin System:
		- Goodreads: textfield (=> linked with MySQL socialmedia_table)
		- Twitter: textfield
		- LinkedIn: textfield
		- Facebook: textfield
	
	- Privacy settings:
		- the Checkin system may share my checkin on twitter when I check-in [checkbox]
		- the Checkin system may share my checkin on the Edge Facebook page when I check-in [checkbox]
	
***login page:
	- turn register button into a basic link so it appears less obtrusive / more simple
	
***signup page:
	- adjust look and feel 
	- leave space for terms and conditions+++
	- add checkbox to confirm that terms and conditions have been read
		


add tables:
- background_table
- edge_users_backgrounds

- privacy_table
- edge_users_privacy


- life rss feed of who has checked in whenÉ.
- twitter feeÉ.

Privacy settings:
- the checkin system may share on twitter when I check-in
- the checkin system may share on the Edge Facebook page when I check-in


IDEAS:
- create pie-visualisation: what background (fixed categories) do people have who are in right now? => click on a graph sector and see what is behind.
- what skills do the regulars at the Edge have (people who have checked in more than once per week on average)
- after checkin: print out little sheet of who's doing what and where at The Edge.




******---LOG--- DONE:
- Done >> 1) change login.php: users should be using their username/pw to
login, not swipe-id/pw.
-Done >> 4) for each skill/expertise text field: create a drop down list
that enables the user to select his expertise level (1 beginner - 5
expert) for each skill,
and connect to DB field: expertise_table->level
- Mark 20 March, 2012 [4) create Processing/JAVA script for VSO's to read an RFID card number and assign it to a user, i.e.
	- VSO opens Processing/Java Program.
	- touches a new (unassigned) RFID card to the ID20 reader (connected to the PC's USB port)
	- Processing/Java Program spits out the RFID card number
	- VSO copy pastes this number into signup.php
	- user fills out username/password
	- VSO labels RFID-card and hands over to user]
